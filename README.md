* [Pet Adoption]() This was a Hacker competion wher you have to find weather the given Pet will be adopted or not based on the give features. I have created a model using Random Forest cclassfication algorithm.

* [Fake or Real Disaster tweet](https://github.com/donrockvic/ML_projects/blob/master/Fake_real_Disaster_tweet/RealOrFakeTweets.ipynb)
Predicted a disaster Tweet is real or Fake using NLTK Tfdf, with an accuracy of 80%. Also implemented data cleaning using python re and different NLP techniques.
<br> Demo: [Live Demo](https://portfoliovsevicky.herokuapp.com/tweet) 
<br> Data: [Kaggle]()

* [Iris Flower Dataset](https://github.com/donrockvic/ML_projects/blob/master/IRIS_flower_classification/iris-dataset-supervised.ipynb):
Created a model to predict flower type on the Iris flower data set. I have implemented a data cleaning pipeline based on % of missing data using Scikit learn.
<br> Data: [Kaggle]()

* [Loan Prediction](https://github.com/donrockvic/ML_projects/blob/master/LoanPrediction/LoanPrediction.ipynb): A supervised learning model to predict whether one can get a loan or not using 12 features, both categorical and numerical.<br>
Demo: [Live Demo](https://portfoliovsevicky.herokuapp.com/loan) 
<br> Data: [Kaggle]()

* [Salary Prediction](https://github.com/donrockvic/ML_projects/blob/master/SalaryPrediction/model.py) : A simple regression salry prediction on the basic of year of experience, a test-score and interview score.
<br>*Max score of test and interview is 10*  
Demo: [Live demo](https://portfoliovsevicky.herokuapp.com/salary) 

*Tools: sci-kit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Keras, NLTK*

I also developed in all other kinds of Technology. You can find a general portfolio [here](https://github.com/donrockvic/General-development).
